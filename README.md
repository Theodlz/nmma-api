## nmma-api
*!!! Work in progress !!!*

This is a simple API, which serves as a middleware and mini database to run [NMMA](https://github.com/nuclear-multimessenger-astronomy/nmma) based on analysis requests coming from [SkyPortal](https://github.com/skyportal/skyportal). This service uses expanse to run the analysis, then grabs the results and sends them back to SkyPortal using a webhook.
